In this repository you will find my readme file as well as a folder named SurfsUp. 
In the SurfsUp folder you will find a climate_started.ipynb file that contains my code for the first part of the assignment. You will also find an app.py file which contains the code for the second part of the assignment using flask.  
In the SurfsUp folder you will find a Resources folder which contains the hawaii_stations.csv, the hawaii_measurements.csv and the hawaii.sqlite. These are the databases used for this assignment.
